# üõçÔ∏è E-commerce Platform | Full-Stack Shopping Application

Welcome to this full-stack e-commerce web application, a comprehensive project built from the ground up to demonstrate a complete MERN stack implementation. This platform provides a modern, intuitive, and secure online shopping experience for users, alongside a powerful and easy-to-use dashboard for administrators.

The goal of this project was to engineer a robust, real-world application that handles everything from user authentication and product discovery to state management and order processing, showcasing a deep understanding of both frontend and backend development principles.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js installed on your machine
* npm or yarn
* MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies**
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following environment variables:**
    ```
    PORT=8080
    MONGO_URI=<YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING>
    JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>
    ```

4.  **Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies**
    ```sh
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Start the backend server**
    ```sh
    # From the 'server' directory
    npm start
    ```

6.  **Start the frontend development server**
    ```sh
    # From the 'client' directory
    npm start
    ```

The application should now be running on your local machine.

## üîå API Design

The backend serves a RESTful API for all data transactions. [cite: 14] Key responsibilities include:

* **User Authentication:** Endpoints for user registration, login, and profile updates, protected with JWT middleware.
* **Product Catalog Management:** API routes for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting products.
* **Order Processing:** Secure endpoints to handle the creation and retrieval of user orders.
